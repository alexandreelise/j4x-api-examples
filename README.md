# j4x-api-examples

## WHY?
If you are a Joomla! developer or want to become a Joomla! developer there is a new resource for you
[The Official New Joomla! Manual](https://github.com/joomla/Manual.git)

If you are eager to learn more about Joomla! Web Services and want to ply around with them using ready to use short examples, sample code and experiments this repo is for you.
The examples are intentionally short with comments and for common scenarios and use cases. So even a non-developer could follow along.
